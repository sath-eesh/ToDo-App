# Today-Only Todo App

This is an iOS Todo Application built using Swift, MVVM architecture, and SwiftData for offline persistence. It enforces a strict "today-only" constraint where tasks expire at the end of the day, ensuring a fresh start every morning.

## 📱 Features

✅ **Today-Only Focus**: Tasks belong strictly to the current day.
✅ **Auto-Expiration**: Tasks from previous days are automatically cleaned up on app launch.
✅ **Local Persistence**: Uses SwiftData to store tasks offline.
✅ **MVVM Architecture**: clear separation of logic and UI.
✅ **Task Management**: Simple add, complete, and delete functionality.
✅ **Offline First**: Fully functional without network access.
